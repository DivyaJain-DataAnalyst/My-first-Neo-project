# NeoRide - Safe and Reliable Ride Booking Platform

NeoRide is a modern, frontend-only ride booking platform designed for safe and convenient transportation experiences.

- Rate drivers with star ratings and leave reviews.
- Store rides and ratings locally in your browser using localStorage.
- Elegant, modern, and user-friendly interface.
- Responsive design suitable for desktops and mobile devices.
- All code contained in a single HTML file for easy deployment and demo.
